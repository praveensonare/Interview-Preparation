STAR
Situation: Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.
Task: 	   What were you asked or expected to do and why? What was driving you (and/or your team) to complete this project or solve this problem? 
	   What were your responsibilities in that situation?
Action:    Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. 
	   Focus on “I," not “we”.
Result:	   Describe the outcome. DO NOT undercut your role in the situation, this is not the time to be modest. When talking about the result, make sure you go over 
           what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important 
	   that something positive came from it. Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. 
	   Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

Q. Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?
	One of my team member in a project whose pace was lagging behind the others.
	We were approaching the production release, so each member is expected to work independently or with limited guidance on the assigned task. The goal was to fix the performance issues and bugs within limited time.
	We got together to address the issue. I explained that although he was falling behind, he could still improve by making a few adjustments to his strategy. Also I tried assign him simple tasks so that he also contribute to production release with limited help from others. 
	His productivity increased and he felt more confident in his work which led successful release and now he also started contributing with new ideas to improve prduct..
