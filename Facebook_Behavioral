Motivations 
Talk about how you can learn from other people, that includes people in your team, other team and the wider company. 
Are you building or working on something impactful that had value for its users? Are you motivated by working in a fast-paced environment to deliver amazing results?
Ans: It is my dream company. I admire FB for their culture, diversity etc. but importantly I like their technical strength for of solving real life problems and 
    introducing new technology to the world where millions of people are using it. I'd like to learn from such people and want to be one of them. 
    In the past I have worked on some of the project which has resemblance with FB products, hence it motivates me further.

    //Working on solving complex problem and innovating solutions for changing the user  for I always like to work on challenging assignement

Conflict Resolution – 
You must have very good examples here of how you have effectively resolved difficult situations or disagreements. 
Ensure that your examples direct attention to the task at hand or goal rather than the person or people themselves. 
Are you somebody that can encourage opportunities and conversation where everyone feels confident to express their opinions? 
You should talk about how you can have self-reflection in a conflict too and take initiative to diffuse a situation. 
When you’re resolving a conflict, are you ensuring the steps you have taken are balanced and satisfy the thoughts of everyone involved 
  and is the best decision for the team/project/company?

Note –  It is essential for senior engineers to have good examples of conflict resolution. 
        NEVER discriminate or undermine people in your examples e.g. gender/age/race/ethnicity/political views 
        and be sure not to talk about someone in a negative way.

Empathy 
You should be able to show how you can gauge the feelings of your team members and/or people in other teams 
and that you can promote a culture which encourages people to voice their opinions and thoughts, which in turn helps everyone to learn and work better together. 
You could talk about how you’re open to adopt ideas that may disagree with your ideas. 
Think about how you have these relationships with somebody you have reported to, a peer and also a team.

Leading
There is an expectation that you can talk about projects that you have lead. Talk about how you measure success and impact of a project (metrics/KPIs/timelines). 
Talk about how you work collaboratively with other teams. Do you drive consensus when scoping a project? 
Are you able to recognise other people’s strengths and delegate? 
If people in the team need support can you give them the opportunity to upskill, can you unblock them? Can you talk about how you mentor/coach/lead other people?

Note – when talking about projects, you need to talk about examples that have a wide SCOPE or HIGH IMPACT.


Growth
Have examples that show how you have been open to constructive feedback and can strive to improve yourself. 
You should be able to talk about what motivates you and how this can relate to your growth. 
What are you doing to continually improve yourself? Can you talk about recognising mistakes or areas to improve beyond not making the same mistake again? 
It is ok to talk about mistakes, we want you to do this… it doesn’t show weakness. It’s likely that you will make mistakes in your role at FB, it’s how we grow.

Being Proactive
Talk about how you can plan your work and use information ahead of time to minimise disruption and if there is an issue, that you can act on it quickly and resolve.

Self-Starter/Perseverance
Can you talk about an approach that ensures you’re executing tasks and delivering a project? 
You should talk about how you take ownership over the things that you can control and influence. 
Examples here should focus on projects with the biggest scope and impact. 
A good engineer can recognise problems however a Senior Engineer can recognise a problem and see it as an opportunity to grow and learn. 
Rather than seeing a problem as a blocker, you should be able to give examples of 
  how you have undertaken responsibilities to solve a problem that can unblock yourself and also unblock other people.

Working with ambiguity
Can you give examples of times that you have taken action in situations or environments where you perhaps don’t have everything you need or if things are unclear? 
Perhaps challenging the norm, even if it means there is a risk of failure, but ensuring you have a logical approach to a goal or final outcome.

Communication
You should be able to talk confidently about your experiences and be able to communicate effectively. 
Don’t be afraid to talk about mistakes, conflict, achievements, motivations… this is completely normal. 
You should be answering with narratives about your experiences and “through the eyes” of a senior engineer. 
You have a finite amount of time to showcase these areas so be concise and focus on impact. 
You may receive follow-up questions to some of your answers - this is normal, be open to feedback and suggestions.
